#OOP:Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which contain data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data, and it focuses on organizing code into reusable, modular, and logical structures.
#class: class is a user defined data tyepe that act as a blueprint for object creation
#object:an object is an instance of a class that represents a real-world entity.
It contains data (attributes/properties) and behavior (methods/functions) bundled together.
#empty object have 1 byte size:The compiler ensures that every object has a unique memory address.

If the size were 0, two different objects of that class could end up having the same address, which would break the language rules.

To avoid this, the compiler assigns 1 byte as a minimum size, just to give it a distinguishable memory location.
